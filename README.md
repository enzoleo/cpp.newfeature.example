# cpp20.dct
This is a simple DCT library written in C++. The motivation is just to test some newly added features in C++20. Currently C++20 is still ongoing and most popular compilers only provide us with [partial support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support) of new features.

## Setup Guide

Unfortunately, both `gcc` and `clang` fail to compile the sources. Let's wait for the fresh release.

```shell
make
```

Run this command to compile the source code. The binaries are generated in the `.build_release/example` directory.
